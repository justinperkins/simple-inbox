simple-inbox has two missions:

1) be simple
2) allow easy access to your auxiliary emails at *@inbox.yourdomain.com
3) no UI to check those emails

you might wonder how you can achieve (2) without (3), but it will do digest emails to your primary email account and provide an RSS feed to see your incoming emails

no UI means it is simple, we are not interested in solving the problem of creating an email interface

prerequisite: a catch-all account setup on gmail with Google Apps with Your Domain
