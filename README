simple-inbox has two missions:

1) provide secondary email addresses at *@inbox.yourdomain.com
2) no UI to check those emails

you might wonder how you can achieve (1) without (2), but it will do digest emails to your primary email account and provide an RSS feed to see your incoming emails

no UI means it is simple
